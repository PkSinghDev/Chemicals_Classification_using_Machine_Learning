# Chemicals Separation Using Machine Learning
### Binary Classification Challenge

#### Problem Statement: -
Aki is a chemist. He has two chemical flasks labelled 1 and 0 which contains two different chemicals. He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them. Aki's task is to create a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 based on it's three features.

#### Train Data: -
This folder consists of two csv files **LogisticXtrain** & **LogisticYtrain**. Xtrain consists of the 3 features, whereas the Ytrain consists of the labels associated with the features.

#### Test Data: -
The folder consists of two files **LogisticXtest** consisting of the features of test data and **sample_output** which represents the format in which the result file should be created.
